This project is an implementation of multiagent behavior in TileWorld environment, where agents try to discover the whole world made of tiles.
This was a team project - script mapCreator.py is result of our cooperation, all other source codes (documentation excluded) are genuinely my work.

I implemented several algorithms as A* with different heuristics, radnom walk and other naive approaches for searching the world, some include agent cooperation. See technicka_zprava.pdf for more information.
